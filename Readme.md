# About

Latest version of my CV, adapted from the template and style file from Adrien Friggeri, [https://github.com/afriggeri/cv](https://github.com/afriggeri/cv)

Not using the Helvetica, but some free fonts, also using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Just as Adrien, using TikZ for the header, XeTeX,  biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside. I adapted some formatting compared to Adrien, with a shortentry-option, an extra sidebar-environment, some bibliographic changes and adaptation of the parskip-length.

The included cover letter template is a small adaptation of the latex letter class to make the style complementary to the cv itself, giving it some uniformity. If wanted, the header of the cv can be included too.
